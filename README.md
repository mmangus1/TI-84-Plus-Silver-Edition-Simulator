# TI-84-Plus-Silver-Edition-Simulator
A web based TI-84 Calculator Simulator, I wanted a replica simulation of a TI-84 calculator I own so the world can use it when the actual physical calculator disappears from shelves. I used an image of the calculator and wrote the rest in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

This is still a work in progress.

## Problems I've faced:
1. No function for imaginary numbers
2. Making the image clickable to run javascript code on the click
3. Making the image responsive, so that it plays well with different screens.
4. Properly formatting output of problems so the use of the program more accuretly represents the actual calculator, such as aligning answers to the right.
